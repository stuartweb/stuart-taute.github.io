## About

Hey! I'm Stuart, and I've put together this little page to showcase some of my work and accomplishments for you. Hopefully you'll learn a little bit about me and get to see some of the cool stuff I've done.

Besides attending <a href="http://www.coe.gatech.edu/stats-and-rankings">the second-best mechanical engineering college</a> in the country and working in <a href="http://haskell.com/About/Performance">one of the world's most progressive and revered engineering firms</a>, I've got plenty of other crazy business going on. I love sports -- I've been an avid volleyball player for about 7 years now. I like to travel, particularly when it means getting to check out Formula One cars in Italy. On an average Sunday evening you can find me either relentlessly chipping away at engineering homework in the library or sitting at home, sipping a local IPA and playing video games with friends.
